    <string name="cis_desc">The Computer Information Systems (CIS) building was constructed to house the Information Systems and Operations Management Department from the Cameron School of Business and the Department of Computer Science from the College of Arts and Sciences. The CIS Building, a new 51,731 square-foot state-of-the-art facility on the UNCW campus, opened January 10, 2007 for the new school semester. Work on the facility began on July 29, 2004 with the groundbreaking, and competed in December of 2006. The building cost approximately $12.8 million and was funded by the North Carolina State Bond campaign of 2000.</string>
    <string name="rl_desc">Originally called the Physics-Chemistry Building, this structure housed classrooms for those departments. Groundbreaking took place in July of 1967, occupation began in 1968, with the official renaming ceremony to DeLoach Hall in October of 1985. Currently the building holds offices and classrooms for the Department of Physics, Department of Physical Oceanography and the Department of Earth Sciences. The Department of Chemistry was housed here until Dobo Hall opened. DeLoach Hall contains a large teaching auditorium and several laboratories.</string>
    <string name="dl_desc">Bear Hall opened at its present site in 1972 as the home for the Business and Economics Departments. Currently, the Departments of Computer Science, Mathematics and Statistics, and Philosophy and Religion occupy classrooms, teaching labs and faculty offices.
